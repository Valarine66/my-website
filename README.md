This website uses a minimalistic design with a simple color palette of blue and green to create a clean and welcoming layout. I opted for a responsive design so that it adapts well to various screen sizes. The use of semantic HTML5 tags ensures good accessibility and SEO practices.

JavaScript Features:

Form validation on the Contact page, ensuring users fill out all fields before submission.
Smooth scrolling effect and interactive form behavior.
Challenges included implementing responsive layouts with proper alignment on mobile screens. I overcame this by using media queries to adjust the design for smaller devices.

Deployment was straightforward using GitHub Pages, ensuring the website is accessible to all users via a unique URL.
